Build Notes
-----------

Linux :

    wxGTK 2.8.x
    ./configure --enable-unicode --with-opengl --enable-mediactrl --enable-graphics_ctx

    add "--disable-shared" for static libraries
    using "--enable-mediactrl" requires gstreamer installation
    
    make
    make install (as root) (not required for static libraries)
   
    Static .a files are built to the "lib" folder.

    The build-specific headers are located in "lib/wx"

    After copying the libs, you need to change a folder name, as it contains a -2.x suffix which we don't need.
    Go into wx.mod/lib/<build>/wx/include/
    You'll see something like mac-unicode-release-static-2.8
    Remove the -2.8, so that it becomes mac-unicode-release-static

MacOS :

    wxMac 2.8.x
    ./configure --enable-unicode --with-opengl --enable-mediactrl --enable-graphics_ctx --disable-shared --with-expat=builtin
	--with-libjpeg=builtin --with-libpng=builtin

    use "--disable-shared" for static libraries, otherwise you get .dylibs
    
    make
    for a shared install use
        sudo make install  (requires admin password)

Win32 :

    wxMSW 2.8.x
    
    edit build/msw/config.gcc, and change the following entries :
            BUILD := release
            UNICODE = 1
            USE_OPENGL = 1

    Also, edit wx/msw/setup.h and enable wxUSE_GLCANVAS :
            #define wxUSE_GLCANVAS       1

            
    make -f makefile.gcc

    creates static .a files in lib\gcc_lib

	Also need to include libwinspool.a, librpcrt4.a and libodbc32.a in the lib folder for distribution. (these come from
	the MinGW distribution)
